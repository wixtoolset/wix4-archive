The wix sources (.wxs files) found here are used to build test patches (.msp files) for use in testing Burn.

Just run the following:

To build: nmake all
To clean: nmake clean

Nmake, WiX tools, cabarc, robocopy, and cscript should be in your PATH. 
If you do this from a wixenv window for a recent wix enlistment it should simply work.


None of these patches supersede another.  They can be installed in any order.
