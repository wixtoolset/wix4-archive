            <p>This application shows a hierarchical, relational, searchable
            view of all of the product, feature, component, file, and patch
            data managed by MSI, for all products installed on the system.</p>
            <p><br/></p>

            <h4>Navigation</h4>
            <ol>
            <li><p>The tree on the left is self-explanatory.</p></li>
            <li><p>Click on a row-header (grey box on the left side of the
            grid) to jump to a table with more details about the item referred
            to by that row. For example, clicking on a row-header of a
            table that lists components will take you to a table that lists
            the files in that component. Not every table has this ability,
            but the cursor will turn to a hand shape to indicate when this is
            possible.</p></li>
            <li><p>Also you can navigate back and forward through your history
            using the buttons in the application or mouse buttons 4 and 5.</p></li>
            </ol>
            <p><br/></p>

            <h4>Searching</h4>
            <p>The search feature is not hard to find. By default, searches
            are limited to the current table. However, if you choose to find
            &quot;In Subtree&quot; by checking the box, the search will include
            the current table as well as all tables under the current location in
            the tree. While this can take a long time if there is a lot of
            data under the current node, you can stop the search at any time with
            the stop button. The search pauses when a match is found, but
            clicking &quot;Find&quot; again will continue the same search from that
            point (unless you uncheck the &quot;Continue&quot; checkbox or change
            the search string).</p>
